1. Introduction</h1>
<p>To use <b>ALox</b>, you need to compile the ALox library and configure your project to link the library. This should not be too difficult to set up and this does not differ from the use of other C++ libraries.</p>
<p>In addition, <b>ALox</b> should get configured to meet your needs. Especially, the format of the log output should be recognizable by your IDE: the source code file name and line number that generated the output should become "clickable" in the log: It should link back to the source in the editor. While different IDEs have different abilities and syntax for that, unfortunately, there are some IDEs that do not support such "clickable log output" at all.<br />
 This document gives some tips for different IDEs in later chapters. We hope that the IDE you are using is listed here. Otherwise, it may need a little testing, maybe some trial and error process, to see how the output needs to be done to be properly consumed by your IDE.</p>
<p>Currently, <b>ALox for C++</b> compiles on the following platforms:</p><ul>
<li>GNU/Linux 32 and 64 bit</li>
<li>Microsoft Windows 32 and 64 bit</li>
<li>Mac OSX 64 bit</li>
</ul>
<p>Ready to use project files are provided for</p><ul>
<li><em>CMake</em></li>
<li><em>Microsoft Visual Studio</em>.</li>
<li><em>QTCreator</em>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Due to the CMake support, many other IDEs like</p><ul>
<li><em>CLion</em>,</li>
<li><em>KDevelop 5</em> or</li>
<li><em>QT Creator</em></li>
</ul>
<p>can import or natively use the <b>ALox</b> library projects very easily.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>For Mac OSX development, we are currently using <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">JetBrains CLion</a> and CMake files. XCode project files are not provided. Your help and input for Mac OSX project file and general compatibility assurance is very welcome!</dd></dl>
<p>If you compile your C++ code with a different build system/IDE, all you need to know is two things:</p><ul>
<li>the list of source files and</li>
<li>which <a class="el" href="cppprepro.html#cppprepro_compsymbols">Compilation Symbols</a> need to be set on compilation of debug and release configurations.</li>
</ul>
<p>To keep this document simple in language, the following terms are used:</p><ul>
<li><em>project</em>: A source code entity defined in an IDE or other build system. Could be a library, an executable or other entity.</li>
<li><em>solution</em>: A 'container' defined in an IDE or other build system that comprises a set of projects that belong together.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a sample: using CMake, the solution would be the <em>CMakeLists.txt</em> file, and the projects would be the targets within such file.</p>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_aloxfolder"></a>
2. Basics</h1>
<p>Clone the ALox repository from <a href="https://github.com/AlexWorx/ALox-Logging-Library">Alox at GitHub</a> to a place where you commonly store 3rd party libraries that your projects are using. Alternatively, download and unpack the ZIP file.</p>
<p>We call this place the <b><em>ALOX_LIB_PATH</em></b>. After a fresh installation, it should contain at least the following subfolders: </p><pre class="fragment">    ALOX_LIB_PATH/build
    ALOX_LIB_PATH/docs
    ALOX_LIB_PATH/html
    ALOX_LIB_PATH/src.cpp
    ALOX_LIB_PATH/tools
</pre><p>Depending on the platform and build system you are using, folder <code>build</code> may contain configuration files that suit your needs and you are quickly set.</p>
<p>If not, it should not be too hard to compile <b>ALox</b> from scratch. Note that <b>ALox</b> relies on <b>ALib</b>, a very basic utilitiy library. The sources of both are found in the following two folders and their sub-folders: </p><pre class="fragment">    ALOX_LIB_PATH/src.cpp/alib
    ALOX_LIB_PATH/src.cpp/alox
</pre><p>All you need to do is to setup a library project with the ALox sources and link this library to your own project.</p>
<p>Optionally, the unit tests (which do not belong into the library) are found in: </p><pre class="fragment">    ALOX_LIB_PATH/src.cpp/alib.unittests
    ALOX_LIB_PATH/src.cpp/alox.unittests
</pre><p>Both, the ALox library and your project might need to pass symbols to the C++ compiler. Be sure to read about the <a class="el" href="cppprepro.html">ALox and the C++ Preprocessor</a> carefully if you setup a project from scratch.</p>
<p>To test your setup, add minimum ALox functionality to your project (as described in the first chapter of <a class="el" href="cpptutorial.html">ALox for C++ Tutorial</a>) into your main method or anywhere you think it is appropriate.</p>
<p>You are set if:</p><ul>
<li>your project compiles and runs without error</li>
<li>you see the log output when running the debug version</li>
<li>you can click the log line in your IDE and it links to the log statement in the editor</li>
<li>you do not see the log output when running the release version</li>
</ul>

3. Using ALox with CMake</h1>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_cmake_intro"></a>
3.1 CMake Files and Targets</h2>
<p>The CMake files provided with <b>ALox</b> were developed and tested with the latest CMake on GNU/Linux (Arch Linux), with the most recent GNU and CLang Compiler Suites. We hope you do not run into too much trouble on other platforms.</p>
<p>As <b>ALox</b> builds upon <a class="el" href="namespaceaworx_1_1lib.html">ALib</a>, there are two CMake files that configure both libraries. These files are </p><pre class="fragment">    ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/cmake.cpp/ALib.cmake
    ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/cmake.cpp/ALox.cmake
</pre><p>The second includes the first automatically, therefore only <em>ALox.cmake</em> needs to be included from any project's CMake file, like this:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line">    include( ../../../build/cmake.cpp/<a class="code" href="namespaceaworx.html#a4d5353279fde6a5d6e5b1c8e776abf66">ALox</a>.cmake )</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> (This snippet is taken from a sample project that resides in a sub-folder, therefore the <em>"../../.."</em>).</p>
<p>Several cached CMake variables are created on the first invocation. Most of them directly correspond to preprocessor symbols as specified in the ALib/ALox documentation: <a class="el" href="cppprepro.html">Compilation Symbols</a>.</p>
<p>With the inclusion of <b>ALox.cmake</b> in your own cmake file two targets, named <b>ALox_StaticLib</b> and <b>ALox_SharedLib</b> get defined. Now, all that is needed is to add the library to your own CMake target, as shown in the following sample: </p><div class="fragment"><div class="line">    add_executable            ( ALoxSamples   ${ALOX_SAMPLES_SOURCES}  )</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    set_target_properties     ( ALoxSamples   PROPERTIES  COMPILE_FLAGS ${AWORX_COMPILE_FLAGS})</div><div class="line">    set_target_properties     ( ALoxSamples   PROPERTIES  LINK_FLAGS    ${AWORX_LINK_FLAGS}   )</div><div class="line"></div><div class="line">    target_link_libraries     ( ALoxSamples   ALox_SharedLib</div><div class="line">                                              ${ALIB_EXTERNAL_LIBS}</div><div class="line">                                              ${ALOX_EXTERNAL_LIBS}   )</div></div><!-- fragment --><p> Notes:</p><ul>
<li><p class="startli">The include directory for ALib/ALox header files (which is implicitly 'inherited' from the <b>ALox</b> library target, here <em>ALox_SharedLib</em>) is: </p><pre class="fragment">  ALOX_LIB_PATH/src.cpp/
</pre><p class="startli">This means that in your projects' source code, header files have to be included using the prefixes <em>'alib/'</em> and <em>'alox/'</em>, for example, the main header files are included as: </p><pre class="fragment">  #include "alib/alib.hpp"
  #include "alox/alox.hpp"
</pre><p class="startli">This is to avoid any collisions with your own or other libraries header file names.</p>
</li>
<li>The variables <em>AWORX_COMPILE_FLAGS</em> and <em>AWORX_LINK_FLAGS</em> define C++ compiler and linker options for target <em>ALox_StaticLib</em>. Of-course, for your target, you can use your own options. Here, we are reusing them, as this snippet comes from an ALox sample project.</li>
<li>When CMake variable <em>ALIB_FEAT_THREADS</em> is <code>true</code> (the default), then the following CMake commands are executed in CMake script <em>ALib.cmake:</em> <div class="fragment"><div class="line">find_package(Threads)</div><div class="line">set( ALIB_EXTERNAL_LIBS ${ALIB_EXTERNAL_LIBS}         ${CMAKE_THREAD_LIBS_INIT} )</div></div><!-- fragment --> Therefore, when adding <em>ALIB_EXTERNAL_LIBS</em> with CMake command <em>target_link_libraries</em>, multi-threading support is already added to your target.<br />
 In the current version of ALib/ALox, no other external library dependencies are set and this is very unlikely to change in the future. This means that CMake variable <em>ALOX_EXTERNAL_LIBS</em> which is also added in the snippet above to the target, is empty and provided only for completeness.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_cmake_sample"></a>
3.2 Building The Sample Project</h2>
<p>To build the sample project, perform the following steps:</p>
<ul>
<li>open a console window and cd into directory: <pre class="fragment">  ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/cmake.cpp/alox.samples/
</pre></li>
<li>create two sub-directories from here, one named <em>debug</em> and the other <em>release</em></li>
<li>cd into directory <em>debug</em> and type <pre class="fragment">  cmake ..
</pre></li>
<li>once cmake has run, type <pre class="fragment">  make
</pre></li>
</ul>
<p>The compiled sample executable should have been created and you can start it with </p><pre class="fragment">./ALoxSamples
</pre><p>When you run it, the output should contain the following lines: </p><pre class="fragment">cout: Do some debug logging:
ALoxSamples.cpp:43:DebugLog [0.000 +---   ][MAIN][/]#001: Hello ALox, this is debug logging

cout: Do some release logging:
[0.000+171 µs][MAIN][/](001): Hello ALox, this is release logging
</pre><p>For a <b>release build</b>, the steps are the same with one important exclamation. After you cd into the 'release' folder, the cmake command is: </p><pre class="fragment">cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
</pre><p>instead of just <em>cmake ..</em>. (The <em>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</em> is set to <em>Debug</em> by default.)<br />
</p>
<p>When you run the executable, the output should contain the following lines: </p><pre class="fragment">cout: Do some debug logging:
cout: should not have logged something (this is the release version)

cout: Do some release logging:
ALoxSamples.cpp:75: ReleaseLog           [0.001 +001 ms][MAIN][/   ]   #001:       Hello ALox, this is release logging
</pre><p>As you can see, the release version is missing the debug log output. You have successfully compiled ALox and a sample project on your platform. Now it is your task to configure your own project that is supposed to use ALox accordingly.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_cmake_unittests"></a>
3.3 Compiling The Unit Tests</h2>
<p>Compiling the unit tests is similar to the steps described above. The project location is</p>
<p>ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/cmake.cpp/unittests/</p>
<p>For the unit tests, <em>Google</em> <em>gtest</em> gets downloaded (once) and incorporated as a source project within the binary folder. This means:</p><ul>
<li>This library does not need to be installed anywhere else on the system</li>
<li>This library gets deleted when deleting the CMake build folder (in the sample above named "debug" respectively "release").</li>
<li>For the download and setup of these libraries, a quick CMake script is downloaded (once): <a href="https://github.com/Crascit/DownloadProject">Crascit/DownloadProject</a>. This scripts downloads the source zip-file once and stores them within the CMake build folder. Hence, even after a "make clean", <em>gtest</em> will not be downloaded twice.</li>
</ul>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_cmake_cotire"></a>
3.4 Using Cotire To Speed-Up Builds</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/sakra/cotire/">Cotire</a> is an open source CMake script which modifies C++ CMake targets in a way to speed up compilation. This is achieved using mainly two techniques: Precompiled header files and so called "unity builds".</p>
<p>The provided CMake script <code>ALib.cmake</code> defines CMake cache variable <code>ALIB_CMAKE_COTIRE</code>. If this variable evaluates to <code>true</code>, then the script downloads <a href="https://github.com/sakra/cotire/">Cotire</a> (once) and includes it. Then, script <code>ALox.cmake</code> applies cotire to the library targets.</p>
<p>To benefit from the unity build option (which cuts build time quite dramatically!) you have two options:</p><ol type="1">
<li><p class="startli">Setup your target to use project <code>ALox_SharedLib_unity</code> instead of <code>ALox_SharedLib</code> (respectively <code>ALox_StaticLib_unity</code> instead of <code>ALox_StaticLib</code>). This should be done depending on the setting of the CMake variable, as shown in the following sample:</p>
<div class="fragment"><div class="line"><span class="preprocessor"># link against unity-built version of library in case of cotire</span></div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">if</span>( ${ALIB_CMAKE_COTIRE} )</div><div class="line">    target_link_libraries     ( dot   ALox_StaticLib_unity  )</div><div class="line"><span class="keywordflow">else</span>()</div><div class="line">    target_link_libraries     ( dot   ALox_StaticLib        )</div><div class="line">endif()</div></div><!-- fragment --></li>
<li>Use cotire for your project as well and then choose the new make target with suffix "_unity" for building. This target will automatically use the "_unity" target version of the <b>ALox</b> library as well. This second approach is used in the provided <b>ALibSample</b> project and CMake file.</li>
</ol>
<p>By default, <a href="https://github.com/sakra/cotire/">Cotire</a> is switched off in the make files provided. This is because it adds a next layer of complexity for compiling <b>ALib/ALox</b>. But it is generally worth to have a try!</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_cmake_notes"></a>
3.5 Further Notes On CMake</h2>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli">To analyze compiler and linker flags, do a manual build from the shell as follows:</p>
<p class="startli">make VERBOSE=1 |grep "/usr/bin/c++"</p>
<p class="startli">(this is not ALox specific, just a reminder, might look different depending on your setup)</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Do not hesitate to open and read the CMake files </p><pre class="fragment">  ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/cmake.cpp/ALib.cmake
  ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/cmake.cpp/ALox.cmake
</pre><p class="startli">They are well documented and may contain some first hints if problems arise.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">Currently, there is no 'installable' version available of ALib/ALox. To avoid compiling the library with your project, you have to compile the project found in: </p><pre class="fragment">  ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/cmake.cpp/alox.lib/
</pre><p class="startli">and include the library to your CMake project <em>'manually'</em> </p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli">The library names get some name extensions depending on the <a class="el" href="cppprepro.html">Compilation Symbols</a> chosen. It is important to not link compilation units with mixed compilation symbols. ALib/ALox have a built-in mechanism to detect such misconfigurations which are automatically invoked with method <a class="el" href="classaworx_1_1lox_1_1ALox.html#a4c4ba727bf8ffe104f310aca32519e36">ALox::Init</a> (also in release-builds).</p>
<p class="startli">Refer to <a class="el" href="classaworx_1_1lib_1_1ALIB.html#a2da37e5ba2741c6d9a1e53a30b446ae4">ALIB::VerifyCompilationFlags</a> and <a class="el" href="classaworx_1_1lox_1_1ALox.html#aa9e4d1c41a132391b46ce5c0ce73af5d">ALox::checkLibraryVersions</a> for more information.</p>

</ul>
<h1><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_ides"></a>
4. Using ALox with Different IDEs</h1>
<p>In the following sections, the use of ALox with different IDEs are discussed. Besides specifics in respect to project setup, an overview about how <b>ALox</b> clickable log output is supported - and achieved! "Achieving" here means most of all to configure the output format in a way that the IDE "understands" the source file and line number information and links them to the editor and source.</p>
<p>To change the format of the log output, field <a class="el" href="classaworx_1_1lox_1_1core_1_1textlogger_1_1MetaInfo.html#a5f73a9d6a9bfabaa4a33c34831006d07">Format</a> of object <a class="el" href="classaworx_1_1lox_1_1core_1_1textlogger_1_1TextLogger.html#a44ec0d8f6ee263114e758dd8d4cd8301">TextLogger::MetaInfo</a> has to be modified. This can be done either programatically, or, if available in the external configuration of an application. If you are new to <b>ALox</b>, the easiest way to play around with different log output formats, is to compile and run the sample project. This will generate an INI-file (in your personal OS-specific configuration folder) and within this file you will find an entry for configuration variable <a href="../group__GrpALoxConfigVars.html">ALOX_LOGGERNAME_FORMAT</a>. You can edit this, and re-run the sample. The log output will change. From here, you can start your own investigations about how to convince your IDE to accept the log statements.</p>
<p>In the configuration file, there are also other configuration variables which can get useful to adjust the log output to a certain IDE. If your IDE is not listed in the following paragraphs, then still reading these might help you in understanding how such support is possible.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_qtcreator"></a>
4.1. QT Creator</h2>
<p><a href="http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/index.html">QT Creator</a> can be used in two different "modes", with CMake files and with QMake files. Unfortunately, in respect to clickable log-output there is a tremendous difference in the behavior of QT Creator. Therefore, we have split this into two different sections.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>When using ALib classes in your project or you want to debug into or extend <b>ALox</b>, please note the special support of <b>ALox</b> for QT Creator <a href="../tools.html#tools_debug_helpers_qtcreator">pretty printers</a>.</dd></dl>
<h3><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_qtcreator_qm"></a>
4.1.1 Using QT Creator with QMake</h3>
<p>The <b><em>ALOX_LIB_PATH</em></b> contains ready to use library, sample, and unit testing projects for <em>QT Creator</em> using its default build system QMake. Those are found in sub-folder: </p><pre class="fragment">    ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/ide.cpp.qtcreator/
</pre><p>Please refer to the <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qtcreator/">QT Creator</a> and <a href="http://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qmake-manual.html">QMake</a> documentation for details on how to use them.</p>
<p>In respect to log output file name recognition, we have made the following observations:</p>
<ul>
<li>When using QTCreator with QMake (!), the IDE recognizes source code information if the line starts with three spaces and the string <code>"Loc:"</code>.</li>
<li>The source information is then to be provided with square brackets.</li>
<li>no other square brackets must occur in the output line</li>
<li>Any color information (ANSI color codes) which otherwise are recognized by QT Creator are removed. You can see colors flashing up shortly sometimes and then they disappear. The reason is obviously that QT Creator parses the output window and colorizes all source links it detects in blue - and removing all other color code!</li>
<li>The rules how source paths are recognized by QTCreator is not known to us. Often, trimmed source file paths are sufficient (see <a href="..\man_trim_source_path.html">Trimming Source File Paths and Clickable IDE Output</a>) but sometimes the full path has to be given. Especially if libraries that use ALox are involved, the trimmed path is sometimes not enough. In this case, a source path trim rule might be created that turns relative source file paths (provided by QMake to the C++ compiler) into absolute ones.</li>
</ul>
<p>From these observations, the following advice can be given:</p><ul>
<li>A plain (non-colorful!) logger of type <a class="el" href="classaworx_1_1lox_1_1loggers_1_1ConsoleLogger.html">ConsoleLogger</a> is to be used created.<br />
</li>

<p>Using external configuration this means to set three variables. For example, an INI-file might contain the following entries: </p><pre class="fragment">CONSOLE_TYPE=                      plain

4.1.2 Using QT Creator with CMake</h3>
<p><em>QT Creator</em> has a built in CMake support which works really well (as of the time of this writing).</p>
<p>To use the pre-build CMake files of ALox with <em>QT Creator</em>, open menu <em>File</em> of <em>QT Creator</em> and choose <em>Open File or Project...</em> and select the file: </p><pre class="fragment">    ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/cmake.cpp/alox.samples/CMakeLists.txt
</pre><p>Follow the project setup as <em>QT Creator</em> documentation suggests. When the CMake run dialog appears, for debug builds, no arguments need to be passed. For release builds, provide </p><pre class="fragment">    -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release
</pre><p>as the CMake Arguments</p>
<p>The ALox sample project is now ready to be build in <em>QT Creator</em></p>
<p>When you run it, the output should look like suggested in chapter <a class="el" href="cppsetup.html#cppsetup_cmake">Using ALox with CMake</a>.</p>
<p>In respect to log output file name recognition, there is some bad news now: When used with CMake projects, QT Creator does not support clickable log lines. At least, we have not found out how! Therefore, we have no recommendation about how to change the log output in respect to make such output clickable.</p>
<p>The output panes of QT Creator support colorful (ANSI) logging and have a light background. Therefore, we recommend to set the following two configuration variables: </p><pre class="fragment">CONSOLE_TYPE=            ansi
CONSOLE_LIGHT_COLORS=    background
</pre><h2><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_vstudio"></a>
4.2. Using ALox with Visual Studio</h2>
<p>When you are new to ALox and you just want to play around with it a bit, the easiest thing is to open the Visual studio solution found in </p><pre class="fragment">    ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/ide.cpp.vstudio/Solution/ALox-CPP.sln
</pre><p>You are set! For example you could walk through the <a class="el" href="cpptutorial.html">ALox for C++ Tutorial</a> by adding the tutorial code to the <code>main()</code> function of the project <em>ALox-CPP-Samples</em>.</p>
<p>ALox provides a Visual Studio project that compiles ALox into a DLL. The projects is located in: </p><pre class="fragment">    ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/ide.cpp.vstudio/ALox-CPP-DLL/
</pre><p>Add this project to your solution and set a build dependency from your project to the just added ALox-CPP-DLL* project. Furthermore, the <em>ALox-CP-DLL project</em> has to be added as a reference to your project. Finally, the ALox include directory has to be added to your project.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>When using ALox in a Microsoft Windows software, it may be important to include <em>windows.h</em> prior to any ALox header file. The reason is, that ALib (used by ALox) includes <em>windows.h</em> unless it was included already. When ALib library includes <em>windows.h</em>, it uses some defines like <em>WIN32_LEAN_AND_MEAN</em> or <em>NOGDI</em> to minimize the impact of that huge header file. If <em>windows.h</em> is included prior to including ALox (AWorx library), it is up to the embedding application which level of windows functionality is needed.</dd></dl>
<p><b>Clickable Log Output with Visual Studio:</b><br />
 As far as we know, clickable log output is only possible to have when launching a project in debug mode. In this case, ALox automatically adds a second logger of type <a class="el" href="classaworx_1_1lox_1_1loggers_1_1VStudioLogger.html">VStudioLogger</a>. (This is the default behavior by default, implemented with method \ŗef <a class="el" href="classaworx_1_1lox_1_1Log.html#a06444d2e7a321e26fe1d4c309cb8ed49">aworx::lox::Log::AddDebugLogger</a> "Log::AddDebugLogger".)</p>
<p>This logger does everything right to have clickable log lines in Visual Studio. No adjustments need to be done.</p>
<h2><a class="anchor" id="cppsetup_clion"></a>
4.3 Using ALox with JetBrains CLion</h2>
<p><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/">CLion</a>s' build system relies on CMake. Hence, opening the projects provided with ALox is just about opening the corresponding CMake files, for example: </p><pre class="fragment">ALOX_LIB_PATH/build/cmake.cpp/alox.samples/CMakeLists.txt
</pre><p>The ALox sample project is now ready to be build in <em>CLion</em></p>
<p>When you run it, the output should look like suggested in chapter <a class="el" href="cppsetup.html#cppsetup_cmake">Using ALox with CMake</a>.</p>
<p>For debugging ALib and ALox code, you might want to install the <a href="../tools.html#tools_debug_helpers_gdb">Pretty Printers for GNU Debugger</a>.</p>
<p><b>Clickable Log Output with CLion:</b><br />
</p>
<p><em>CLion</em> has an intelligent output console that supports ANSI colors and detects links to files automatically. The file name without path is sufficient and this way, the default format string should do fine.</p>
<p>There is one specialty about the ANSI color support: CLion does not support light colors. Therefore, the use of light colors has to be switched off. If this is not done, colors are in most cases not effective.</p>
<p>As a summary, these or similar configuration variable settings are recommended: </p><pre class="fragment">[ALOX]
CONSOLE_TYPE=           ansi
CONSOLE_LIGHT_COLORS=   never
DEBUG_LOGGER_FORMAT=    %SF:%SL:%A3%SM %A3[%TC +%TL][%tN][%D]%A1#%#: %V,    \
                        \e[31m,                                             \
                        \e[34m,                                             \
                        ,                                                   \
                        \e[33m</pre> </div></div><!-- contents -->
