# 1. Hello ALox # {#tutjava_hello_alox}

<BR>
## 1.1 Create a tutorial project or equip your current project with ALox ##   {#tutjava_createproject}

If you want to follow the tutorial samples and play around with it a little, you should
either create a tutorial project or right away equip your current project with ALox.

For information about how you do that see: \ref setup_projects_java.

\note
You can easily skip this step and just continue reading the tutorial without setting up ALox now.


<BR>
## 1.2. Create an instance of class "ConsoleLogger" ##  {#tutjava_ha1}

First our project needs to create an instance of class [ConsoleLogger](@ref #com::aworx::lox::loggers::ConsoleLogger) 
that enables log output to the application console as well as to the "console" or "output" window of your preferred IDE.
You need to identify the right place in your application. This could be the "main()" method or any
other place where some "bootstrapping" of your application takes place.

Once you have identified the right place, add the following statements to the "using section* of your source
file:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_using_statement

Now return to the place you identified where the initialization of the *logger* should take place and 
add the following:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_Hello_ALox_Line1

A *logger* of type [ConsoleLogger](@ref #com::aworx::lox::loggers::ConsoleLogger) is created and added to the
static interface class [Log](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log). For now, we can forget about the class ConsoleLogger.
After it was created, we do not touch it directly for the rest of this introductory tutorial. As you might
guess, other Loggers could be added in parallel that write the output to other "drains", e.g. log files.

<BR>
## 1.3. Add code to create and set a *log domain* ##     {#tutjava_ha_3}

Just after the line we just inserted, add a second line of code:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_Hello_ALox_Line2


This tells ALox about a *log domain* called "APP" and assigns the *log domain level* InfoWarningsAndErrors to it.
If you did not understand too much of the last sentence, don't worry, the concepts of *log domains* and *log levels* will get 
very obvious to you in 5 minutes. 

<BR>
## 1.4. Add log code ##                             {#tutjava_ha_4}

Just after the line we just inserted, add a third line of code:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java Tut_Hello_ALox_Line3

This is now your first log output! The whole three lines you inserted into your application (besides the using statement)
should look like this:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_Hello_ALox


<BR>
## 1.5. Run your application ##        {#tutjava_ha_5}
Run your application in "Debug" mode. In the console window of your IDE (or on your JAVA console window) you should see
a line of output similar to this:

\verbinclude  docs/generated_javatut/Tut_Hello_ALox.txt 

If using Eclipse, close your source file window. In the console window a portion of the output line
should be blue and clickable. When you click it, Eclipse opens the source and selects the line of code where 
the log call was invoked! This means, each log statement is "clickable" in your IDE and links to its source code line in the
editor. This is a tremendous help for developers when debugging their code. 

Besides the fact that you can click it, users of ALox are saving even more time. Developers, when
using standard "debug print lines", often phrase textual info like 

        "attn: dbman.savedata(): oops could not store data....ERROR!"

putting some info about the place in the code, where they have put the debug statements. As you see from the 
ALox output above, information about the *caller* of the log statement is all included automatically. 
Advantages are:

- lines are clickable and link to the editor (because ALox formats the caller information accordingly)
- less to type when adding debug print lines
- no change needed when you copy/paste a debug print line to a different class/method
  or when you rename your class/method

As we will see later, the log message type (which seems to be "ERROR!" in the phrase above) is standardized 
in ALox and does not need to be phrased in your message text.

Besides caller information and message type, you automatically get:

- the relative time of the log execution (time since application started)
- the time elapsed since the last log
- the ID of the thread that executed the method
- the *log domain* of your log statement

The output format and detail of the log line is configurable in ALox. The line above just shows
the default. Details you see can be removed or other details can be added (e.g. the absolute 
date / time instead of only the relative). 

\note
You should adjust your Java IDE in a way that the console window spans over the complete 
width of the main window. Also, depending on your screen size, you might decrease the font size of 
the output window a little. The output gets wide, because a lot of valuable information is logged 
besides the log message. In addition, the output is organized in columns that auto adjust their size
taking a wider output into account.*

## 1.6. Build Release Version ##                              {#tutjava_ha_6}

Switch your project configuration to "Release" and run the application. The output should not appear!
                                                                                                     
Even better: The three lines of code are not even compiled into the release target. So, whatever you 
are logging out during developing and debugging your software, it is all automatically gone in the 
release version.

This is due to the **ALOX_DEBUG** compile symbol we added to the project properties at Step 1 of 
this tutorial. Only project configurations that have this symbol set will contain code invoking calls 
to class [Log](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log).

This has a lot of benefits:
- your release code executes faster
- your release executable gets a smaller footprint
- you are not delivering your debug language to the end user (not even if your executable is reverse engineered)
\~

# 2. Log levels and log domains #                                          {#tutjava_llld} 

<BR>
## 2.1. Log code with different log levels ##   {#tutjava_llld_1}

Switch back to the Debug configuration. The code above uses the method [Log.info()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::info) to create the 
log output. There are three other Versions of that method, together constituting the four "log levels":

-  [error()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error)
-  [warning()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::warning)
-  [info()]		(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::info)
-  [verbose()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::verbose)

Each of the methods accepts the *log domain* ( in our sample "App") and the log message as input parameters.
Internally all four methods differ only by using a different *log level*. The tricky thing that needs to be understood is that 
such *log level* is compared with the *log domain level* that the domain currently is assigned to. In our sample
code, with the second line of code:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_LogLevels_SetDomain

we have assigned [InfoWarningsAndErrors](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel ) to the domain "APP".
The possible domain log levels are:

-  [OFF						](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel)
-  [ERRORS					](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel	)
-  [WARNINGS_AND_ERRORS		](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel )
-  [INFO_WARNINGS_AND_ERRORS](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel )
-  [ALL						](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel )

Let us extend our sample code and see what happens. Replace the last line (the log call) by four
different log calls and let your code look like this:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_LogLevels

If you run your application now (in "Debug" mode), the following output should appear:

\verbinclude  docs/generated_javatut/Tut_LogLevels.txt

As you see, the last line of our code, containing the [verbose()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::verbose ) log statement was not logged!
This is because in line two of the code of we set the *log domain level* to [WARNINGS_AND_ERRORS](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel ). 
This tells the logging system that logs implemented with the method [verbose()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::verbose) are not to be logged.

The following table lists the domain log levels in the columns and the *log level* in the rows and shows which log levels are
activated when a certain *log domain level* is set:


<table border="1" >
    <tr> <td> <center>Domain Level / Log Level</center></td>
      <th width="100">VERBOSE</th> <th width="100">INFO</th> <th width="100">WARNING</th> <th width="100">ERROR</th>   </tr>
    <tr><td><b><center>OFF</center></b></td>
      <td><center>No</center></td> <td><center>No</center></td> <td><center>No</center></td> <td><center>No</center></td></tr>
    <tr><td><b><center>ERRORS</center></b></td>
      <td><center>No</center></td> <td><center>No</center></td> <td><center>No</center></td> <td><center>Yes</center></td> </tr>
    <tr><td><b><center>WARNINGS_AND_ERRORS</center></b></td>
      <td><center>No</center></td> <td><center>No</center></td> <td><center>Yes</center></td> <td><center>Yes</center></td> </tr>
    <tr><td><b><center>INFO_WARNINGS_AND_ERRORS</center></b></td>
      <td><center>No</center></td> <td><center>Yes</center></td> <td><center>Yes</center></td> <td><center>Yes</center></td> </tr>
    <tr><td><b><center>ALL</center></b></td>
      <td><center>Yes</center></td> <td><center>Yes</center></td> <td><center>Yes</center></td> <td><center>Yes</center></td></tr>
</table>


Fairly easy, right? To summarize, the above paragraph introduced you to the concepts of:
1. *Log domains* as a parameter of the four log methods 
   [error()]		(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error), 
   [warning()]		(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error),
   [info()]			(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error) and
   [verbose()]		(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error)
2. *Log domain levels* that are assigned to *log domains*  as values of [Log.DomainLevel](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel ) at runtime 
   using the method [Log.setDomain()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::setDomain )
3. *Log levels* that are assigned to each log statement in your code by choosing the right log method.

Now, you should understand how the comparison of the *log domain level* and the *log level* decides about whether a log is executed or not.


<BR>
## 2.2. Default domains ##          {#tutjava_llld_2}

If you already liked the tiny code that is necessary to implement ALox Logging, then you 
will appreciate this section, because we want to make it even smaller. Replace the 
code you added to your project so far by this one:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_DefaultDomains

The output now is:

\verbinclude  docs/generated_javatut/Tut_DefaultDomains.txt


OK, you might argue, the code became longer: We added line 2, which invokes [Log.regDomain](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::regDomain).
This method registers the domain with ALox (the same as [Log.setDomain](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::setDomain) obviously does implicitly) and
offers the possibility to set the given domain name as the default domain for the actual 
[Scope]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::Scope) (package, class or method).

What becomes less code however are the log statements 
[error()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error), 
[warning()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error),
[info()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error) and
[verbose()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error). They do not need to have the domain as a parameter any more! This provides the 
following advantages:
- less typing
- easier reading
- you can just copy/paste your log lines to different sources, without adjusting the *log domain* (done automatically)
- you can change the name of the domain by changing it in a single place.


\note
- *You can still use the log methods including the parameter to overwrite the default domain*
- *You can address "sub domains" relatively to your default domain within a source that got a default domain* 
\par
\note
For further reading on domains and *sub domains*, see [corresponding chapter](../man_levelsanddomains.html) 
in the ALox user Manual.

To be honest, both functions, [Log.regDomain](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::regDomain) and  [Log.setDomain](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::setDomain)
are not needed, so the shortest code to do ALox logging in your code could be:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_DefaultDomains_part2

Which produces the output:

\verbinclude docs/generated_javatut/Tut_DefaultDomains_part2.txt 

From this example we learn that *log domains* which are neither registered with [Log.regDomain](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::regDomain) nor
set with [Log.setDomain](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::setDomain) do not cause any problem. ALox just creates them on the fly
and continues its job. 

The *domain level* that such *unknown* domains receive is inherited through the domain chain up to the root domain. The root domain
is a field existing in each *logger*. By default the root domain of a [ConsoleLogger](@ref #com::aworx::lox::loggers::ConsoleLogger) has
its *domain level* set to *All*. This is extremely useful, because whenever you are using 3rd party code that defines its custom 
domain names, you can easily identify those domains in your console window log stream. In contrast, other loggers that
you create for specific purposes (e.g. log only messages of certain domains into a file), do not enable
*unknown* domains as a default. Therefore, these special purpose loggers stay clean and log only what you explicitly ask them to log.


<BR>
## 2.3. Where to place ALox log code ##               {#tutjava_llld_3}

As we now know a bit about *log domains*, we can briefly talk about where to 
add ALox statements in your code. In the standard application setup, there are three
places, plus an optional fourth one.

### 1) Create Loggers and define domain levels in **the bootstrap section** of your application ###
When your application loads, as early in the lifecycle as possible,  you usually want
to create your loggers and set some *log domain level* values for a selected *log domain*. 

A good place is the **main()** method or whatever the earliest entry point to your code is.

Code for this section would look like this:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_Placing_Part1

Of course, you can add and remove loggers anywhere in your code. Also, you can 
modify *domain log levels* later at runtime as you please. 

### 2) Register Domains in static initializers of your classes  ###
Java allows classes to have static initializers that are executed exactly once 
(in the moment when either the first object of that class type is created or a static
member of that class is accessed). It is a good practice to add code that registers 
exactly those *log domains* that a class is using by adding a static constructor and  
using [Log.regDomain](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::regDomain) to perform the registrations.

Here is an example:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_Placing_Part2

\note
- While a domain needs to be registered only once, it does not 'hurt' to register domains 
  multiple times.
- If you want to set a domain as default for several packages, you have to choose at 
  least one class of each package and add a static initializer to it as described above.
- If you set different default domains with [Scope.PACKAGE]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::Scope) 
  within different static initializers of classes that reside in the same package, then it 
  becomes quite random which domain is chosen (the one whose static initializer is invoked latest). 
  The good new is: if a different domain for a package gets registered, ALox provides a 
  warning log message.


### 3) Add log messages anywhere in your code  ###
The third part is obvious: you add log statements in your code as you please.
Looking at the above sample class, we register two domains "MYDOM" and its 
*sub domain* "PERF". Consider the *sub domain* "PERF" is used for 
performance log statements Somewhere in the class a method **heavyCalculation()** 
is invoked. A typical use of ALox would look like this:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_Placing_Part3

In the log output of the second line you automatically get the absolute value of elapsed
time displayed. There is no need to do your own math with the timestamps. In fact, the value
is displayed in a human readable way, depending on the size of the time span. (This is
true as long as your *logger* has the field [Logger.logTimeDiff](@ref #com::aworx::lox::core::Logger.logTimeDiff)
set to true, which is the default for most loggers)

\note
In above code sample, of-course, there is no need to indent heavyCalculation() between 
the two log statements, but doesn't this look nice and intuitive?*

As "PERF" is a *sub domain* of "MYDOM" and "MYDOM" got set as the *default domain*
for the source file, the domain "MYDOM/PERF" could be also referenced using "~PERF". 
The code then looks like this:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_Placing_Part3b

Advantages of this approach are:
- less typing
- you can copy/paste the code into a different class (with a different parent domain) without changing it.


### 4) Name your threads  ###
The fourth and really optional one is about multi threaded applications. ALox optionally
logs information about the id and name of the thread that executed the code containing your log
statements. This is an automatic process and can be switched on or off using the boolean flag
[Logger.logThreadInfo](@ref #com::aworx::lox::core::Logger.logThreadInfo).

However often threads do not have a nice name. It would be much nicer to see a readable
name instead. ALox provides a simple mechanism to overwrite thread names using 
[Log.mapThreadName](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::mapThreadName) interface.

The mechanism is simple, however it might not be simple to identify the right place in
the code to put it! Some code can be executed from different threads, and sometimes 
(for example when using an UI framework) you might not even know exactly which thread will invoke
your code. However, the good news is that each thread ID has to be mapped only once during
the lifecycle of the program, but may be mapped multiple times. Therefore, the guideline is: 

- Identify a piece of code from which you are sure that only one certain thread invokes that code.
- Make sure that this code is not executed frequently to avoid the mapping overhead.
- Make sure that this code is executed early in the lifecycle of your application.

For the sample of UI Frameworks, a good place to invoke [Log.mapThreadName](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::mapThreadName)
is the initial creation callback of your main application UI component. Normally, it is 
enough to put this statement only in one component (the main one), because all other components
will be initialized by the same Framework thread. 

But as this is a convenience concept anyhow, it is good practice to not care too much
about it at first. Later, when your application grows, you can check your log files periodically for new, unmapped
thread IDs. When you see one, scroll up in the log file and try to identify the very first appearance
of this new ID. A double click in the log line will open the code that invoked the log.
If you have populated your code with a reasonable amount of log entries, you will end up at the 
right place automatically! It also might be a good idea to restart your app with all domains set
to verbose level and then look for the first appearances of unknown threads.

# 3. Some more Details {#tutjava_more}
<BR>
## 3.1 Stop reading here? ##        {#tutjava_more_1}

Developers are often in a hurry and reading tutorials is time consuming.
If you are only using the part of ALox the tutorial has covered up to this point you should
already benefit a lot from the ALox library and your programmer's life should have become easier and more
fun. 

A-Worx (the maker of ALox) is a consultant to the software industry and one area of 
competence is code style and code cleanness (sorry, we don't want to be advertising here). 
Therefore, we emphasize our clients to stop using *temporary debug print lines* in 
their sources. Instead, use ALox (or a similar tool) and all your debug output lines should 
be implemented tidy and clean using a nice language. With ALox, such debug output should
never be temporary again and as such never be removed from the code! Programmers often remove
debug output after they think a piece of code works. But if problems arise or if the code
is further extended at a later stage, similar lines are inserted and re-written. 
This is obviously a waste of time. 

If you want and have the time to continue reading, you are invited to learn more
pretty neat features. Here we go!


<BR>
## 3.2 Conditional logging ##        {#tutjava_more_2}

Often log lines should only be displayed if a certain condition is met. Here is a
sample:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_ConditionalLogging

The last two lines can be replaced by one follows: 
    
\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_ConditionalLogging2

Advantages are again less typing and better readability of the code. Furthermore, the Java compiler
would probably not prune the *if statement* if it was a more complex evaluation. 
As with using *Assert()* the evaluation of the expression is definitely pruned from your code. (Be
sure you do not put side effects into expressions of *Assert()* invocations.

\note
- In accordance with the concept of assertions, the condition has to be 'false' to have ALox perform the log.*
- The *log level* of *Assert()* is *Log.Level.ERROR*
- The method Assert() starts with capitalized "A" because "assert" is a key word in Java.

The method [Assert()] (@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error) in class [Log]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log) is
similar to the other log methods (namely 
[error()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error), 
[warning()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error),
[info()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error) and
[verbose()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error) ) just a shortcut into the full featured
log method [Line()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::line), setting some default parameters.


<BR>
## 3.3 LogTools: Log complex things easily ##       {#tutjava_more_3}

ALox also provides some log functions that log more complex stuff. The design decision was made to not
put this into the class [Log](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log) but into a separated class [LogTools](@ref #com::aworx::lox::LogTools).
However, LogTools is used in the same simple fashion as class Log itself. Consider it just an extension or
another word for Log. 

On the Java language platform two methods are currently available which are briefly covered in the following:

### 3.3.1 Instance(): Log any object recursively

The method [LogTools.instance()] (@ref #com::aworx::lox::LogTools::instance) allows you to log just any object 
recursively in a well formatted way. You can try this out quickly by adding the following code to your sample:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_Instance

As you can see, we are just passing a quite complex object, the current thread, to the method. The parameter
that follows the object which is to be logged (the current thread) determines the level of objects which are recursively logged,
starting from the given one (composite objects). You can play around with it, and increase it from 2 to lets say 5. But
be careful: this can lead to a quite long log message! 

The given parameter "Actual Thread: " provides a headline for the log output. This allows you to save another
line of code, which would be logging the headline explicitly.

Here are the first lines of output of the above sample:
                             
\verbinclude  docs/generated_javatut/Tut_Instance.txt 

\~Comment 
\note 
This uses the inspection features of Java. Unfortunately under Windows Phone development
inspection is not a feature. Therefore, this method is not available for Windows Phone projects. TODO: HOW IS THIS IN ANDROID?
\~

### 3.3.2 Exception(): Log an exception recursively (with inner exceptions) 

Just like Instance(), the method [LogTools.exception()] (@ref #com::aworx::lox::LogTools::exception) uses the multi
line feature of ALox to log out the contents of a Java Exception well formatted and recursively (following inner exceptions).
 
Of-course a perfect place in your code to add [LogTools.exception()] (@ref #com::aworx::lox::LogTools::exception) is
the first line within a *catch() block*. 

To try it out, add the following code into your project:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_Exceptions


Like the method [LogTools.instance()] (@ref #com::aworx::lox::LogTools::instance), a headline for the Exception log output can be specified.
This allows you to save another line of code, which would be logging the headline explicitly.

The following log output will be generated:

\verbinclude  docs/generated_javatut/Tut_Exceptions.txt 

\~Comment  NIY in Java (when adding, change number some paragraphs above
### c) XML(): Log out an XML document or element

The third method in LogTools that logs a complex object is [LogTools.exception()] (@ref #com::aworx::lox::LogTools::exception) for
logging objects of type XMLDocument or XMLElement. Here is a quick sample code:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_XML

The output will look similar to this:

\verbinclude  docs/generated_javatut/Tut_XML.txt 
\~

<BR>
## 3.4 Indentation ##                    {#tutjava_more_4}

The outputs of the above samples which make use of the [LogTools](@ref #com::aworx::lox::LogTools) class look nice because 
they use indentation when they recursively walk through a complex object.

Indentation is a core feature of every single log method. We just did not use it yet, because
it is hidden as a default parameter.

See the documentation of the log methods
[error()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error), 
[warning()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error),
[info()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error) and
[verbose()]	(@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::error) to identify where to add the indentation parameter.
The default is 0. The result of increasing it depends on the Logger you are using. The [TextLogger](@ref #com::aworx::lox::core::TextLogger)
for example (the base class of [ConsoleLogger](@ref #com::aworx::lox::loggers::ConsoleLogger) ) adds two spaces per indent number.

## 3.5 Separating domains levels in different loggers ##        {#tutjava_more_5}
Because  ALox stores the *log domain level* not only per *domain* but also 'per *logger*', we just 
need to fill in a default parameter in [Log.setDomain()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::setDomain ) to
provide different *loggers* different domain levels. 

In the following sample code we are creating two different *loggers*, one 
[ConsoleLogger](@ref #com::aworx::lox::loggers::ConsoleLogger) and one of type 
[MemoryLogger](@ref #com::aworx::lox::loggers::MemoryLogger). The latter just logs into an internal
buffer.
Then we add three different *log domains*:
- "DOM" that should log to both loggers
- "DOM/CON" that should log only to the ConsoleLogger
- "DOM/MEM" that should log only to the MemoryLogger

Let's have a look at the code first:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_SeparatedLogLevels

Running the sample, we get the following log on the console:

\verbinclude  docs/generated_javatut/Tut_SeparatedLogLevels.txt 

The way we achieved the goal is that we use the method [Log.setDomain()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::setDomain ) twice
on each of the *sub domains*. And in contrast to previous samples, we are passing two more parameters to it:
- *bool recursive*
  This parameter defaults to true and tells ALox to not only set the given *log domain* but all its *sub domains*
  to the Log.DomainLevel provided. We set this to false, we do not have further sub domains either way.
- *String loggerFilter*
  This parameter now is what helps us: It defaults to null and in this case does not filter any *logger*. So, when omitted,
  all *loggers* are affected. If given, however, only those *loggers* who's field [Logger.name](@ref #com::aworx::lox::core::Logger.name) 
  match the given filter string are affected. 

Looking back at the code, you will understand what is going on: For each *logger* we enable, respectively, disable
the output of messages for the corresponding domains using [Log.setDomain()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::setDomain ) 
and passing the appropriate filter!

\note
- String comparison on [Logger.name](@ref #com::aworx::lox::core::Logger.name) and parameter *loggerFilter* is case insensitive.
- ALox provides a minimum 'wildcard' feature here: *loggerFilter* can start or end with an '*' character to fetch
  more than one logger at once.

Some further quick remarks on the code:

- [MemoryLogger.buffer](@ref #com::aworx::lox::loggers::MemoryLogger::buffer) provides public access to its data.
  See class [MString](@ref #com::aworx::util::MString) for more information.

- As you can see from the output, the two log lines contained in the MemoryLogger are in two separated
  lines by the *ConsoleLogger*. This is a feature of [TextLogger](@ref #com::aworx::lox::core::TextLogger), the 
  super class of both, *ConsoleLogger* and MemoryLogger to log out multi-line data in a readable format. 
  Hence, logging all kinds of text documents (e.g. XML) results in a readable output. 
  The multiple line output can be modified in some ways and also can be turned off.
  \~Comment TODO: See in depth section TextLogger \~

- At the beginning of the sample, we are tweaking the output in the MemoryLogger a bit.
  The flags we are setting here are available to all Loggers as they are defined in the abstract class 
  [Logger](@ref #com::aworx::lox::core::Logger) already, but might be differently handled by  different 
  *Logger* implementations. What we are achieving in this sample, is that the log output does not get too wide.

\~Comment TODO: pruning

- The tweaks we do on the *MemoryLogger* are surrounded by "#if ALOX_DEBUG ... #endif". This is necessary as
  these lines of code are not automatically removed in the release version of the project. 
  Remember, the good news is that all methods invocations of class [Log](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log) are automatically
  pruned!

## 3.6 ALox configuration and internal log messages ##               {#tutjava_more_6}

In complex projects it might get a little confusing to keep track about the 
loggers and their domains. Also, when you use 3rd party components supporting ALox, 
then you might not know exactly which *log domains* get registered and used by those.

While the sample of the previous section is not too complex, for this tutorial it is 
great to demonstrate two different ways to have ALox log about itself. 

From the previous sample we take the setup section, remove the log output and add a
new line at the end instead:     

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_LogConfig

We are invoking [Log.logConfig()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::logConfig)  which logs the current
configuration of ALox. The output is quite self explanatory:

\verbinclude  docs/generated_javatut/Tut_LogConfig.txt 

Besides this, there is a second option to inspect what happens internally in class *Log*.
Again, from the previous sample we take the setup section, remove the log output and add a
parameter in the first line of code, where the *ConsoleLogger* is added to *LOG*:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_LogConfig2

ALox is equipped with an *internal log domain* named "ALOX". This domain is used by ALox to log messages, 
from error() to verbose(). Now, when you add a *logger* to class *Log*, this *internal log domain* is 
registered with this *logger*.

With the modification in the code above, we are passing a *log domain level* as a second parameter to 
[Log.addLogger()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::addLogger).  This *log domain level* specifies how the
internal *log domain* of ALox should be set. While the default value was  
[DomainLevel.INFO_WARNINGS_AND_ERRORS](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel) we overwrite this to 
[DomainLevel.ALL]                (@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::DomainLevel). Now looking at the *ConsoleLogger*
output, we see what is going on inside ALox while running the application:

\verbinclude  docs/generated_javatut/Tut_LogConfig2.txt 

To summarize: We have to ways to look into ALox: 

1. Method [Log.logConfig()](@ref #com::aworx::lox::Log::logConfig) creates a log with a "snapshot" of the current states. The advantage of this is,
   that it is all logged sequentially in one place and does not clutter your log output.
2. By setting the *log domain level* of the internal log domain "ALOX" to a more verbose level. While this clutters your log output and you 
   might have to search the pieces in your overall log stream, the advantage here is that you see the caller information and therefore
   you see "where" a certain manipulation of the settings took place...and you can click on it!


There is also the possibility to enable the internal domain **after** a logger was already added. The code looks like this:

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_LogConfig3

Or even better, because the internal domain name is not "hard coded":

\snippet java.unittests.alox/unittests/com/aworx/lox/Tests_Tutorial.java        Tut_LogConfig4

# Further reading #     {#tutjava_end}

This is the end of the Java Tutorial of ALox. You should be able to use most of the features
of the ALox Logging Ecosystem and have nice, formatted, configurable log output in your software
projects.

Probably the most important thing that this tutorial does **not** cover is release logging.

For further information, you can read into the [ALox User Manual](../manual.html) and of-course, also read through
the [AWorx class reference](annotated.html) pages.
