##Quick Overview ##

ALox is a small and efficient software library that provides an ecosystem to support structured and organized 
log output.

The library attempts to make logging as easy and lightweight as possible. One of the goals
we want to achieve is that developers, once making use of the library, just stop to put any temporary debug output
statements into their code, but do it all with nice, readable, configurable, reusable logging statements
that can be switched off and that are furthermore automatically pruned out of release versions of
the application.

On the other end of the list, we want to enable release logging for productive applications to collect
mission critical metrics and data from *the field*.
Basic support for release logging is here today already. The introduction of new features and concepts
in the area of release logging will also support debug logging aspects of ALox. Therefore the natural path
of evolution for the ALox project is "debug features first, release features next".
