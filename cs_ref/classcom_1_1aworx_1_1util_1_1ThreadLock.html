<div class="textblock"><p>This class allows <em>mutual exclusive access</em> to resources shared by different threads. In other words, access to certain data that is accessed by different threads, can be protected if each thread (aka critical section code) uses the same <a class="el" href="classcom_1_1aworx_1_1util_1_1ThreadLock.html" title="This class allows mutual exclusive access to resources shared by different threads.

">ThreadLock</a> to control the access to such data. </p>
<hr/>
<p> If an Acquire is not followed by a corresponding Release, other threads will not be able to gain control to this object and will wait endlessly (deadlock situation). To avoid this, it is a good practice to embed pairs of <a class="el" href="classcom_1_1aworx_1_1util_1_1ThreadLock.html#ab91dc804181f48b0b445ac1299c36c05" title="Thread which invokes this method gets registered as the current owner of this object, until the same thread releases the ownership invoking Release(). In the case that this object is already owned by another thread, the invoking thread is suspended until ownership can be gained. Multiple (nested) calls to this method are counted and the object is only released when the same number of Release() calls have been made.

<p>Furthermore, <a class="el" href="classcom_1_1aworx_1_1util_1_1ThreadLock.html" title="This class allows mutual exclusive access to resources shared by different threads. In other words, access to certain data that is accessed by different threads, can be protected if each thread (aka critical section code) uses the same ThreadLock to control the access to such data. ">ThreadLock</a> allows to disable locking using setUnsafe(). The objective here is to gain execution speed, as thread synchronization causes relatively expensive system calls. Nevertheless, it is sometimes obvious that the same code may run in a thread safe mode one time and without thread locking the next time. Therefore, for performance critical code, it is quite useful to be able to control this behaviour.</p>
<p>Caution: Use this class with great care. Deadlocks are not easy to detect and debug. Use this class only if standard synchronization of the Java language seems too limited and mechanisms like the class uses internally would need to be implemented. </p>
